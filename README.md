### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack Typescript developer with a focus on front-end technology - particularly in Angular. I'm also a team player who loves to learn and teach, promoting best practices and with an always curious mind. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently architecting and building high performance enterprise-level applications and APIs with Angular, NestJS and Mongo in Nx monorepo style.
